We order (or “rank”) the content you can see in your Feed, and you can learn more about the different types of signals we use to rank it. We also suggest content that’s relevant to you.Many things influence the content you see in your Feed.For example:If your friends, connections or people you may know interact with a Facebook Page, post or certain topic, we can suggest similar content to you. So if your friend Ahmad comments on a post about national parks, we can suggest the national parks post to you.If you and others interact with the same group, Facebook Page or post, we can suggest another group, Page or post that they interact with for you. So if you and Sharmila are in the same cat lovers group and Sharmila likes a Page that sells scarves, we might suggest the scarves Page to you.If you’ve recently engaged with a certain topic on Facebook, we might then suggest other posts that are related to that topic. So if you recently liked or commented on a post from a basketball Page, we could suggest other posts about basketball.You might see posts based on where you are and what people near you are interacting with on Facebook. So if you’re near a sports stadium, we can suggest games or events occurring at the stadium.

The seller shares Jane’s activity with us using our Business Tools, subject to our Business Tools Terms.Later, Jane sees an ad on Instagram for a discount on her next shoe purchase from the online store.If she doesn't want to see ads from this shoe store again, she can hide them in her Advertisers setting. Or if she doesn’t want us to show her any ads based on her activity on other websites and apps, she can make sure that this setting is turned off in her Ad preferences.Topics we think you might be interested inFor example, Jon likes several Facebook Pages about famous musicians, so we think he has an interest in "music."Based on this interest, we might show him an ad for a local record shop or an online music publication.Jon can manage his interests in his ad topics.Your connectionsFor example, Fiona’s friend likes an Instagram account for a local art fair. Based on her friend’s activity, we might show Fiona an ad for the art fair.31Other device signals we receiveWe receive different types of device signals from different operating systems. They include things like nearby Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections.32IP addressStands for "internet protocol address." It’s a unique number assigned to a device, like a phone or computer, that allows it to communicate over the internet. Numbers are assigned according to standard guidelines, or protocols.Just like you need a mailing address to receive a letter from a friend, your device needs an IP address to receive information on the internet.33Personalizing ads for you and othersFor example, Marcus is going on a trip and wants to use Find Wi-Fi to find free, public Wi-Fi at the airport. He has turned on Location Services on his device and allowed location access on the Facebook app, so we can use his GPS information to help him find the most relevant public Wi-Fi networks.

These vital interests include protection of your life, physical or mental health, wellbeing or integrity or that of others, and detecting, removing, and reporting illegal content. In protecting such vital interests we aim to combat harmful conduct and promote safety, integrity and security, including, for example, when we are investigating reports of harmful conduct or taking appropriate action, such as sharing information with relevant authorities, when someone needs help.Your activity and information you provide:Content you create, like posts, comments or audioContent you provide through our camera feature or your camera roll settings, or through our voice-enabled featuresMessages you send and receive, including their content, subject to applicable lawMetadata about content and messagesInteractions with Meta's artificial intelligence technology and related metadata.

We try to predict your ad interests based on the information we have, including any choices you've made in Ad preferences.Advertisers tell us which audience they want to reach based on who they think will be most interested. This can include things like age, gender, location where advertisers want to show their ad or interests, such as women, based in Dublin, who like golf.We review the potential ads that we could show you to identify the most relevant ones. Our ads system automatically reviews all the potential ads where you might fit the audience that advertisers want to reach. For example, you may see potential ads because you match the age range and interest category. We determine which ones to show you based on things like whether it best achieves the advertiser’s goal and is most relevant to you. To do this, we use algorithms and machine learning to order the ads we may show you. We use different factors such as the ad quality, the advertiser's desired audience and budget. We also consider how likely we think it is that you will react to the ad based on things like your activity on Meta Products. Learn more.All of this information helps us show you the most relevant ads. When you see an ad on Meta Products (e.g. in your Facebook Feed), we use this process to choose the most relevant ad to show you.84How we promote safety, security and integrityWe share your information with law enforcement, government authorities, Meta Companies and other third parties (including industry peers) when we have a good faith belief it’s necessary to detect, prevent and address a variety of situations, such as:Unauthorized use of our Products. See an example.[85]Violations of our terms and policies. See an example.[86]Investigating suspicious activityProtecting ourselves, including our rights, property, personnel or ProductsPreventing abuse, fraud, or other harmful or illegal activity, on and off our ProductsProtecting you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiriesEmergency situations, such as risk of death or imminent bodily harm85Unauthorized use of our ProductsFor example, if you unlawfully collect and use Facebook user data, we may share your information to defend ourselves against claims or in litigation.86Violations of our terms and policiesFor example, if you post threatening or harmful content, we may share your information across the Meta Companies to protect ourselves and others. This can include blocking your access to certain features or disabling your account across the Meta Companies.Return to topCookies PolicyExplore the policyWhat are cookies, and what does this policy cover?Why do we use cookies?Where do we use cookies?Do other Companies use cookies in connection with the Meta Products?How can you control your Information?Other policiesTerms of ServiceCookies PolicyWhat are cookies, and what does this policy cover?Effective December 12, 2023Cookies are small pieces of text used to store information on web browsers. Cookies are used to store and receive identifiers and other information on computers, phones and other devices. Other technologies, including data that we store on your web browser or device, identifiers associated with your device and other software, are used for similar purposes. In this policy, we refer to all of these technologies as “cookies”.We use cookies if you have a Facebook or Instagram account, use the Meta Products, including our website and apps, or visit other websites and apps that use the Meta Products (including the Like button). Cookies enable Meta to offer the Meta Products to you and to understand the information that we receive about you, including information about your use of other websites and apps, whether or not you are registered or logged in.This policy explains how we use cookies and the choices you have. Except as otherwise stated in this policy, the Privacy Policy will apply to our processing of the data that we collect via cookies.Return to topWhy do we use cookies?Cookies help us provide, protect and improve the Meta Products, such as by personalising content, tailoring and measuring ads, and providing a safer experience. The cookies that we use include session cookies, which are deleted when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which stay in your browser until they expire or you delete them. The cookies we use and how we use them[1] may change over time as we improve and update Meta Products, we typically use them for the following purposes: AuthenticationWe use cookies to verify your account and determine when you’re logged in so that we can make it easier for you to access the Meta Products and show you the appropriate experience and features.For example: We use cookies to keep you logged in as you navigate between Facebook Pages. Cookies also help us remember your browser so you don't have to keep logging in to Facebook and so you can more easily log in to Facebook via third-party apps and websites. For example, we use the "c_user" and "xs" cookies, including for this purpose, which have a lifespan of 365 days.Security, site and product integrityWe use cookies to help us keep your account, data and the Meta Products safe and secure.For example: Cookies can help us identify and impose additional security measures when someone may be attempting to access a Facebook account without authorisation, for instance, by rapidly guessing different passwords. We also use cookies to store information that allows us to recover your account in the event that you forget your password or to require additional authentication if you tell us that your account has been hacked. This includes, for example, our "sb" and "dbln" cookies, which enable us to identify your browser securely, as well as “datr." "Datr" is a unique identifier for your browser that, amongst other things, helps us protect you from fraud. For example, it helps us identify trusted browsers where you have logged in before. “Datr” has a lifespan of 400 days.We also use cookies to combat activity that violates our policies or otherwise degrades our ability to provide the Meta Products.For example: Cookies help us fight spam and phishing attacks by enabling us to identify computers that are used to create large numbers of fake Facebook accounts. We also use cookies to detect computers infected with malware and to take steps to prevent them from causing further harm. Our "csrf" cookie, for example, helps us prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. The “datr” cookie also helps us to identify the browsers used by malicious actors and to prevent cyber-security attacks, such as a denial of service attack that could prevent you from accessing the Meta Products. Cookies also help us prevent underage people from registering for Facebook accounts.Advertising, recommendations, insights and measurementWe use cookies to help us show ads and to make recommendations for businesses and other organisations to people who may be interested in the products, services or causes they promote.For example: Cookies allow us to help deliver ads to people who have previously visited a business’s website, purchased its products or used its apps and to recommend products and services based on that activity. Cookies also allow us to limit the number of times that you see an ad so you don’t see the same ad over and over again. For example, the "fr" cookie is used to deliver, measure and improve the relevancy of ads, with a lifespan of 90 days.We also use cookies to help measure the performance of ad campaigns for businesses that use the Meta Products.For example: We use cookies to count the number of times that an ad is shown and to calculate the cost of those ads. We also use cookies to measure how often people do things, such as make a purchase following an ad impression. For example, the "_fbp" cookie identifies browsers for the purposes of providing advertising and site analytics services and has a lifespan of 90 days.Cookies help us serve and measure ads across different browsers and devices used by the same person.For example: We can use cookies to prevent you from seeing the same ad over and over again across the different devices that you use.Cookies also allow us to provide insights about the people who use the Meta Products, as well as the people who interact with the ads, websites and apps of our advertisers and the businesses that use the Meta Products.For example: We use cookies to help businesses understand the kinds of people who like their Facebook Page or use their apps so that they can provide more relevant content and develop features that are likely to be interesting to their customers.We also use cookies, such as our "oo" cookie, which has a lifespan of 400 days, to help you opt out of seeing ads from Meta based on your activity on third-party websites. Learn more about the information we receive, how we decide which ads to show you on and off the Meta Products and the controls that are available to you.Site features and servicesWe use cookies to enable the functionality that helps us provide the Meta Products.For example: Cookies help us store preferences, know when you’ve seen or interacted with Meta Products’ content and provide you with customised content and experiences. For instance, cookies allow us to make suggestions to you and others, and to customise content on third-party sites that integrate our social plugins. If you are a Facebook Page administrator, cookies allow you to switch between posting from your personal Facebook account and the Facebook Page. We use cookies such as the session-based "presence" cookie to support your use of Messenger chat windows.We also use cookies to help provide you with content relevant to your locale. For example: We store information in a cookie that is placed on your browser or device so that you will see the site in your preferred language.PerformanceWe use cookies to provide you with the best experience possible.For example: Cookies help us route traffic between servers and understand how quickly Meta Products load for different people. Cookies also help us record the ratio and dimensions of your screen and windows and know whether you’ve enabled high-contrast mode, so that we can render our sites and apps correctly. For example, we set the "dpr" and "wd" cookies, each with a lifespan of 7 days, for purposes including to deliver an optimal experience for your device’s screen.Analytics and researchWe use cookies to better understand how people use the Meta Products so that we can improve them.For example: Cookies can help us understand how people use the Facebook service, analyse which parts of our Products people find most useful and engaging, and identify features that could be improved.Third-party websites and appsOur business partners may also choose to share information with Meta from cookies set in their own websites' domains, whether or not you have a Facebook or Instagram account or are logged in. Specifically, cookies named _fbc or _fbp may be set on the domain of the business partner whose site you're visiting. Unlike cookies that are set on Meta's own domains, these cookies aren’t accessible by Meta when you're on a site other than the one on which they were set, including when you are on one of our domains.
